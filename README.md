# Binance Dashboard Python

## Description
Simple binance dashboard desktop app based in Python
This app allows to search all the cryptocurrency assets and pairs from binance, show their last close prices and get the percent change by interacting with the chart.

- Standard library modules used:
  - Tkinter : Native python library to create GUI
  - Matplotlib : Popular library to make any kind of plotting.
  - Requests : Library intended to make GET and POST requests in Python.

- Project was made entirely in Python 3.9 and tested in Window 10.

## Setup

- Clone the repository in your local machine.
- Run the app.py file from the console as:
  > python app.py

- How to use

## What I learned from this project

- I learned to structure a project in different files using the MVC pattern in order to make it easier to scale the project as new features are added.

- I learned to group different parts of the project as classes to make it easier to manage from the main file.

- Dived deep into the backend of Tkinter and Matplotlib libraries to better know how they work and then create better user experience features.

## Future Work
<!-- - ~~Add TDD to test all the features.~~ âœ… -->
- [x] Use MCV pattern to organize the project.

- [ ] Add zoom-able and scrollable charts.

- [ ] Show the start of each week to better see the historic proportions.
